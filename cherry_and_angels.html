        <h1 >Cherry Blossoms</h1>
        <div class = "story">
            <p>They all notice him. How can they not? He’s standing in the middle of the road, surrounded by a rain of soft pink petals. He's standing in the exact spot where his best friend had been killed when a car hit him while he was riding his bike on the last day of the previous semester. But that’s all they do. Notice him. They notice him and pause briefly before returning to their eager conversations about the upcoming semester.</p>
            <p>As bikes whistle past him, their wheels squeaking and rattling, he feels the newly familiar feeling of acid racing up his throat and a chill settle in his body as the squeaking and rattling becomes louder and more taunting. He tries to calm his hammering heart, and when he finds that he cannot, he sprints the rest of the way to school, running away from the nightmarish sounds of the bike.</p>
            <p>He gets to class and scoots past the empty aisle table – save for sticker residue, a wilted flower, and a familiar faded smiley face – to reach his seat by the window. During lunch, he pulls out two sandwiches and puts one on the empty table next to him as if his deskmate would suddenly appear and start eating and joking with him. </p>
            <p>When the school day has ended, he stays until all his classmates have left and looks at the untouched sandwich. He wonders if he should leave it there like an offering to a dead ancestor. In the end, he picks up the sandwich and reminds himself to tell his mom to not make the extra.</p>
            <p>As he retraces his steps from the morning, the cherry blossoms coat the ground like a dainty pink carpet, having settled without the presence of bikes messing it all up. He turns to tell someone to look at the pretty road before realizing that there is no one. So when he looks up to blink away tears, he sees that the trees only have a scattering of survivors. Most of its branches are empty, and the surviving petals are lonely, separated from their friends by forces out of their control.</p>
            <p>“I miss you.” The air barely passes through his lips, and as the wind blows, he closes his eyes and clasps his hands, hoping that the wind will carry his words to his friend.</p>

            <h3>The End</h3>
            <div class = "story">        
                Helen! I can’t wait to see you!” Danielle felt the wind whip through her hair as she stared out at the city from her vantage point. Tiny bright lights dotted the entire city, each one signifying a life that was currently thriving. Danielle hadn’t thrived ever since her best friend had died. All she had was a heart that felt like it was getting crushed over and over, crumpled sheets on a bed she never left, a living room with no life, and an endless stream of tears.
                <p>Their friends tried their best to bring her out of the dark abyss Helen left behind – bringing her soup and calling her – but all of them were also grieving. Danielle didn’t want to leave the void she let herself fester in. She had tried at first, going to work as normal, going to the police station to give witness statements, going back to her empty apartment, going back to the police station to ask about the investigation. But she had finally climbed to the top of the building after the police informed her that the investigation would be terminated due to lack of sufficient evidence.
                </p><p>Even though she knew Helen would want her to live, how could she when her best friend, her home, her crutch and her support was gone? She knew it wasn’t her fault, but she felt like she could’ve stopped Helen from running into the explosion or gotten her to the hospital quicker. The world had not given her much in the first place, and the only good it gave her, it took away just as quickly. All it had taken was being in the wrong place at the wrong time for Danielle’s whole world to be blown up.
                </p><p>Danielle fell back from the top of the building, and soon she was flying and falling, the air and wind barely moving out of the way in time. She watched the stars get further and further away but knew that she was going to be part of them very soon. As she whispered a last goodbye, she looked up into the full moon.
                </p>
       <h3>Four</h3>
            <p>The sterile white doors glared at Danielle as she paced outside the surgical room. 
            </p><p>“She’ll be okay,” said Emilia as she tried to tug Danielle into the chair next to her. 
            </p><p>“Are you trying to convince yourself?” Danielle turned and looked at Emilia with bloodshot eyes, gesturing at her tapping foot. Suddenly the doors swung open and a doctor walked out, eyes so apologetic that Danielle knew what had happened before the doctor even spoke.
            </p><p>“Can I see her?”
            </p><p>The doctor led them into the room that had been cleaned up, leaving only a table with a pristine white sheet and a human-shaped lump underneath. Danielle walked over, feeling like her body was moving on its own, but also feeling like she was walking in a dream. When she reached the table, she felt a tiny part of her tell her that it couldn’t possibly be Helen under the sheet. It had to be some terrible, cruel joke she could get mad at Helen for and lightly punch her and pretend to ignore her for two hours before Helen apologized by bringing her good food and she would pretend to keep being angry but eat the food and offer Helen some and they would all be happy again.
            </p><p>Reaching over the table with trembling hands and lifting the corners of the crisp sheet, Danielle stopped breathing. A ringing echoed in her ear, the sharp scent of antiseptic pierced her nose. As she struggled to draw in a breath, the faint taste of chlorine lingered on her tongue. Her hands dropped the corners of the sheet, her mind racing to comprehend her best friend’s lifeless face. Eventually, her brain concluded that this was a dream – no, a nightmare – and Danielle pinched herself. 
            </p><p>Why am I not waking up? She pinched herself harder. And then again. And when she went to do it again, someone grabbed her arm. 
            </p><p>“Danielle, stop! You’re hurting yourself.”  A shaky voice reached Danielle through a muffled haze, like sound reverberating through water. Danielle vaguely registered the crying voice ask the doctor for a band-aid. Danielle fell still.
            </p><p>It’s not a dream. It’s not a dream. IT’S NOT A DREAM! 
            </p><p>Danielle fell to the ground, hand clutched on her heart, and curled into a fetal position. She felt like someone had taken the bomb that ended Helen’s life, shoved it into her heart, and set it off. She screamed; it felt like something was trying to claw out of her, but couldn’t get out. She screamed again, the tears coming this time. She kept screaming until she was hoarse and cried by Helen’s side until she passed out. 
            </p>
            <h3>Three</h3>
“NO!” Danielle ran towards Helen, who had wrenched her hand away from hers as soon as she’d spotted the bomber run into the middle of the bush-lined square. Helen sprinted towards the little girl. The flowers Danielle had bought for Helen lay forgotten on the ground. The ground trembled violently and a loud offensive BOOM! invaded Danielle’s ears. Shards of concrete and rock shot at Danielle, who dropped to the floor and wrapped her arms around her head, feeling the debris attack her arms and back. As the heat wave rushed through her, Danielle peeked through her arms and watched with horror and panic as Helen turned her back towards the explosion to shelter the little girl in her embrace, and was blasted into the ground.
Danielle tried to shove down the panic that started to choke her as she stood up – knee buckling slightly – and ran over to Helen’s prone body, feet crunching over the now crispy and burnt flowers, to kneel by her side. She did her best to gently extract the girl from Helen’s embrace with shaking hands and handed the little girl to her mom – who was sobbing and saying, “Thank you. I’m sorry. Thank you.”
Nodding brusquely towards the woman, Danielle asked her to call an ambulance and ripped the bottom of her shirt. She started binding Helen’s bloody and charred wounds, trying to do anything to stop the life from flowing from her best friend’s body. Helen put her red and blistered hands on Danielle’s as she struggled to tie a knot in the tourniquet she knew wouldn’t do anything. 
	“It’s ok.” Helen’s smoke-kissed voice came out hoarse and raspy. She lightly squeezed Danielle’s hands, her torn up and bleeding skin too rough, too wet, and too warm against Danielle’s hands, cold as if someone had taken the life from her. “It’s worth it.”
“But–” Danielle stopped, tears streaming down her face and she felt her nose start getting stuffed. She glanced at the little girl to make sure she was out of earshot, “I don’t think it was worth it.” 
After she wound the bandages into tourniquets, she gently carded one hand through Helen’s hair hoping to keep her awake, and used the other hand to fan the acrid smoke that burned her nostrils away from Helen. Her own heart pounded. Where are they? As her eyes scanned the streets for the blinding red and blue lights, she slowly looked up into the sky, where the half-moon shone through the veil of smoke.
<h3>Two</h3>
“Why’d you fight them?” Danielle asked, walking into their living room with a roll of bandages and antiseptic. 
	Helen sat on their black cloth couch, holding an ice pack to the right side of her cheek which was heavily bruised. Yet, it was not as bad as her cut lip, the gash on her left arm, and the badly scraped knees which were slowly oozing blood.
	“I couldn’t just let them bully that kid…”
	Danielle raised a singular eyebrow at Helen, before sighing and pouring antiseptic onto a cotton Q-tip. The sharp familiar scent of the ethanol hit Danielle’s nose as she lifted her hand to Helen’s arm and handed her a towel – which Helen put into her mouth, the movements so fluid and familiar.
	“You’re literally 26. You could just call the cops.” Danielle put down the Q-tip, reaching for the roll of bandages as Helen let out a sigh of relief, the towel dropping onto her legs. “I’m sure they’d–”
	“Help? Nah, you know how it is.”
	Danielle sighed and sat down on the low-profile light oak coffee table they had chosen together when wandering through and messing around in IKEA. She patted her lap and Helen lifted her legs to put them on Danielle’s lap. Danielle dabbed another Q-tip in antiseptic and Helen picked up the towel again. 
	“Either way, you should NOT beat up a bunch of teens!” 
“ZHEY ESERVED UT!” Helen spat out the towel. “Anyways, they were like 20.” Danielle leveled Helen with an unamused look and continued to dab at Helen’s scratched knees. Helen hissed but didn’t move her legs. “She was 14.” 
Danielle stopped dabbing at Helen’s wounds for a few seconds, hand hovering over Helen’s knees. She looked out the window at the full moon, whose light filtered through into their living room and thought about how she and Helen had met. Suddenly, something warm enveloped her hand, and she broke out of her stupor.
“You good?” Danielle looked at Helen, whose eyes soothed her mind like hot cocoa on a winter’s day. She turned to stare at the bright red scratches on Helen’s knees, which reminded her of Helen’s injureies. She put down her Q-tip and began rolling the bandage around Helen’s knees. 
	“You should really stop rushing into these things. One day… I tell you Helen…one day I won’t be here to get you out in time and you’re going to get really hurt.”
Helen rolled her eyes. “You’re so mature for your age.” Sufficiently bandaged up, Helen stood up – pushing away Danielle’s panicked hands that sought to pull her back down – and went over to the brown bag she’d carried home, having refused to let Danielle look inside, and revealed an opera cake.
Danielle sighed again and looked down, not only because she’d had this conversation with Helen too many times to count, but also to prevent her from seeing the surprise and delight in Danielle’s eyes and her twitching lip corner. “I can’t believe you’re older. You know, when you inevitably end up in the hospital, I’m gonna say I told you so.”
Danielle accepted the fork Helen handed over and scooped the cake into her mouth, closing her eyes to savor the rich chocolate and cream. Helen watched her take a few bites before finally digging in herself. Content silence filled their apartment as they enjoyed their weekly dessert.
	“Yeah, but you’ll come visit me in the hospital?” Helen smiled with the right side of her mouth, emphasizing her dimple. She lowered her eyes and batted her eyelashes with as much tact as an elephant in a ballroom, smudging fudge on her eyelid. 
	“Yeah, I will.” Danielle giggled for the first time since she had come across Helen throwing herself at the three 20-year-olds. She had gone to pick Helen up from the boxing gym where she worked and saw her best friend attempting to take on three guys alone. Running over, she threatened to call the cops, which promptly scared off the delinquent trio.
“But only because you bought my favorite.” Danielle reached over to rub the chocolate off of Helen’s eyelid, thumb as light as a feather. They looked into each other’s eyes before giggling together.
	Now, the two cuddled on their couch sinking into a soft sea of pillows and blankets, the smell of rubbing alcohol still faintly in the air. Danielle stared into their soft yellow lamp, eyes glazed over and belly full. Helen’s hand was in hers, pulsing with warmth and comfort. She listened to Helen’s breath – in, out, in, out – undulating and ebbing like a wave accompanied by the light chirping of cicadas out to see the full moon. 
Eyes fluttering, Danielle said, “You won’t actually end up in the hospital right?”
“I won’t.” Helen’s voice was barely a whisper, her consciousness already halfway to the land of dreams.
“Promise?”
“Promise.” 
<h3>The Beginning</h3>
The first time they met hadn't been the first time. They thought that they met after Danielle’s stepmom and step-brothers beat her up and kicked her out of the house on a Friday night.
She lay on her back, pain and heat pulsing from her stomach and ribs, a stark contrast from the cold, hard concrete on her back. She made no effort to move, curious to see if the shadowed reaper would take her. Her breath hitched as she watched the full moon, its bright white light piercing her eyes. She groaned, the sound echoing off the walls. Suddenly, she heard footsteps and painfully sucked her breath in. Was this the end? She waited for the footsteps to stop, only to feel her heart stop as she saw a shadow form over her.
“Need help?” A hand reached down and Danielle took it to help her stand up, clutching her side and letting out a wheeze. There was 18-year-old Helen, a sideways smile on her face and a healing cut on her right cheek, silhouette outlined by the silver light of the moon. “Wanna stay over at my house?”
Despite her logic running around in her head and ringing every warning bell, Danielle felt an odd sense of comfort and familiarity and nodded. 
For the first two nights, Danielle thought the living situation was temporary. Helen offered Danielle what she could: a bowl of mac and cheese, a ham and cheese sandwich, and more. Yet Danielle only ate a peanut butter sandwich and two glasses of milk. Despite her initial good feeling, she tossed and turned on the couch and watched the slowly waning moon, worried that Helen would come in at any moment and demand that she pay her back for the food. And beat her if she couldn’t provide the money. 
By the time it was Sunday night, Danielle had already mentally prepared herself to leave and decided that she’d ask the only adult in her life at the moment for some advice before departing. “Should I still go to school tomorrow?” 
Helen fell silent. “Yeah, you should. It's important.” She sat down on the dirty white couch and picked up the worn-out notepad and a pen, eyes scanning the lines. Tapping the notebook with the pen, she looked satisfied and said, “I’ll pick you up after work.”
Danielle’s eyebrows shot up. “You’re letting me live here tomorrow too?” The fourteen-year-old danced lightly on her feet like a bird ready to flee at any minute. Her heart hammered, no one was nice to her without reason. The last time someone who wasn’t Helen was nice to her, she had ended up without lunch for a week. It resulted in her passing out on the hard blacktop for hours before she recovered, slowly climbed back to her feet, and limped home. 
“I guess I am.” Helen paused. “That’s why you have to go. Don’t wanna be arrested for preventing a minor from attending school.”
“Why?”
 
	In reality, the first time they’d met had been when both of them were in school together, a first grader and a fifth grader. Helen was lying on the ground injured after having been pushed off a ledge by her classmates who had left her there after laughing. Seven-year-old Danielle had wandered over, and not realizing the social norm to stay away from the outsider, she helped Helen up and accompanied her to the school nurse. That day, when Danielle had leaned over Helen with the sun shining behind her, Helen thought she saw an angel in person. After that day, Helen was pulled out of school to be “homeschooled,” but never forgot about the tiny angel she had seen in fifth grade when she was lying on the ground, injured and bloody from a fall. 

	“I don’t know. You seem familiar.”

	Danielle, lying on the ground, injured and bloody from a fall, saw Helen’s angel lit by the moon and stars come to take her away from this world.
