<!DOCTYPE html>

<head> <!-- describes the main content of the page (metadata) like what character coding the browser should use -->
  <meta charset="utf-8"> <!-- optional to specify the character set but recommended -->
  <title> Welcome to Daisy's Website!</title> <!-- This is REQUIRED to be here!! otherwise HTML is invalid -->
</head>
<body> <!-- viewable content -->
Honestly, I don't know if this is going to work! Here are some notes on Div and Span
<div>*** DIV 1: Some content here ***</div>
  <div>*** DIV 2: Following right after div 1 ***</div>
  <span>*** SPAN 1: Following right after div 2 ***</span>
  <div>
    *** DIV 3: Following right after span 1 
    <span>*** SPAN 2: INSIDE div 3 ***</span>
    Continue content of div 3 ***
  </div>
  Now I'll make some headings!
  <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1> <!-- going from most to leas importance -->
  <h2>Subheading 2</h2>
  <h3>Subheading 3</h3>
  <h4>Subheading 4</h4>
  <h5>Subheading 5</h5>
  <h6>Subheading 6</h6>
</body>
